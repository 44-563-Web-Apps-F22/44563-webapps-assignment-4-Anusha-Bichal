        <h4><span>PATIENCE</span>  I have escaped with difficulty from my Reginald.  I 
            wanted to see you so much that I might ask you if you still love
            me as fondly as ever?</h4>

        <h4> <span>GROS</span>.  Love you?  If the devotion of a lifetimeâ€” <p>[seizing her hand.]</p>

        <h4><span>PATIENCE</span>[indignantly]  Hold!  Unhand me, or I scream!  [He releases her.]  If you are a gentleman, pray remember that I am
            another's!  [very tenderly.]  But you do love me, don't you?

        <h4> <span>GROS</span>.  Madly, hopelessly, despairingly!</h4>

        <h4>  That's right!  I never can be yours; but that's right!</h4>

        <h4> <span>GROS</span>.  And you love this Bunthorne?</h4>
