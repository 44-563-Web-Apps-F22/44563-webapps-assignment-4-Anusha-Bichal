                No. 18. When I go out of door
            </h5>
            <br>BUN.  It is all right!  I have committed my last act of ill-
            nature, and henceforth I'm a changed character.
          
            <br>[Dances about stage, humming refrain of last air.  Enter
                 PATIENCE, L.  She gazes in astonishment at him.]
          
            <br>PATIENCE  Reginald!  Dancing!  And — what in the world is the
            matter with you?
          
            <br>BUN.  Patience, I'm a changed man.  Hitherto I've been gloomy,
            moody, fitful — uncertain in temper and selfish in disposition—
          
            <br>PATIENCE  You have, indeed!  [sighing]
          
            <br>BUN.  All that is changed.  I have reformed.  I have modelled
            myself upon Mr. Grosvenor.  Henceforth I am mildly cheerful.  My
            conversation will blend amusement with instruction.  I shall
            still be aesthetic; but my aestheticism will be of the most
            pastoral kind.
          
            <br>PATIENCE  Oh, Reginald!  Is all this true?
          
            <br>BUN.  Quite true.  Observe how amiable I am.  [Assuming a fixed
            smile]
          
            <br>PATIENCE  But, Reginald, how long will this last?
          
            <br>BUN.  With occasional intervals for rest and refreshment, as long
            as I do.
          
            <br>PATIENCE  Oh, Reginald, I'm so happy!  Oh, dear, dear Reginald, I
            cannot express the joy I feel at this change.  It will no longer
            be a duty to love you, but a pleasure — a rapture — an ecstasy!
          
            <br>BUN.  My darling!  [embracing her]
          
            <br>PATIENCE  But — oh, horror!  [recoiling from him]
          
            <br>BUN.  What's the matter?
          
            <br>PATIENCE  Is it quite certain that you have absolutely reformed -
            - that you are henceforth a perfect being — utterly free from
            defect of any kind?
