               Act II SCENE — A wooded glade, with a view of open country in the
               background.  The chorus of MAIDENS is heard singing in the
               distance.  JANE is discovered leaning on a violoncello,
               which she has propped up on a tree-stump, L., and upon which
               she will presently accompany herself.  As the Chorus ends,
               she speaks. <br>No. 18. When I go out of door<br>
            </h4>
            <br><h4>BUN. </h4> It is all right!  I have committed my last act of ill-
            nature, and henceforth I'm a changed character.
          
            <br><p>[Dances about stage, humming refrain of last air.  Enter
                 PATIENCE, L.  She gazes in astonishment at him.]</p>
          
            <br><h4>PATIENCE  </h4> !  Dancing!  And — what in the world is the
            matter with you?
          
            <br><h4>BUN.</h4>  Patience, I'm a changed man.  Hitherto I've been gloomy,
            moody, fitful — uncertain in temper and selfish in disposition—
          
            <br><h4>PATIENCE  </h4> You have, indeed!  <p>[sighing]</p>
          
            <br><h4>BUN.</h4> All that is changed.  I have reformed.  I have modelled
            myself upon Mr. Grosvenor.  Henceforth I am mildly cheerful.  My
            conversation will blend amusement with instruction.  I shall
            still be aesthetic; but my aestheticism will be of the most
            pastoral kind.
          
            <br><h4>PATIENCE  </h4>  Oh, Reginald!  Is all this true?
          
            <br><h4>BUN.</h4>  Quite true.  Observe how amiable I am.  <p> [Assuming a fixed
            smile]</p>
          
            <br><h4>PATIENCE  </h4> But, Reginald, how long will this last?
          
            <br><h4>BUN.</h4> With occasional intervals for rest and refreshment, as long
            as I do.
          
            <br><h4>PATIENCE  </h4> Oh, Reginald, I'm so happy!  Oh, dear, dear Reginald, I
            cannot express the joy I feel at this change.  It will no longer
            be a duty to love you, but a pleasure — a rapture — an ecstasy!
          
            <br><h4>BUN.</h4> My darling!  <p>[embracing her]</p>
          
            <br><h4>PATIENCE  </h4> But — oh, horror!  <p>[recoiling from him]</p>
          
            <br><h4>BUN.</h4>  What's the matter?
          
            <br><h4>PATIENCE  </h4>  Is it quite certain that you have absolutely reformed -
            - that you are henceforth a perfect being — utterly free from
            defect of any kind?
